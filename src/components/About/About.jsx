            Hello! I'm Oliver, a Junior Web Developer transitioning from a
            12-year career as a CNC programmer in aerospace engineering. My
            experience in aerospace has equipped me with precision,
            problem-solving skills, and technical expertise.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interest in software development grew as I began using coding to
            enhance my work in CNC programming. This curiosity led me to fully
            immerse myself in learning web development, where Iâ€™ve applied my
            analytical mindset and attention to detail to mastering various
            programming languages and frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am now eager to bring my dedication and problem-solving abilities
            to the software development field. Thank you for visiting my
            portfolio. I look forward to connecting and exploring new
            opportunities in this exciting industry.
